# Why do we need functions?

You've come across functions many times so far, but the view on their merits that we have given you has been rather one-sided. 
You've only invoked the functions by using them as tools to make life easier, and to simplify time-consuming and tedious tasks.

When you want some data to be printed on the console, you use ```print()```. 
When you want to read the value of a variable, you use ```input()```, coupled with either ```int()``` or ```float()```.
