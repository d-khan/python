# Syllabus (CISC-179 Python Programming) Honors Contract  
__This syllabus is for Honors Contract Students only__  

## Course description
In this course, you will learn the universal concepts of computer programming, the syntax and semantics of the Python language, practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges, how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library, how to install your runtime environment, how to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.

The students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to do independent research, extra assignments, and 1:1 online meetings with the professor. The student will be involved in Work-Based Learning activities in which students get in touch with career services, improve resume writing and interviewing skills, and get in touch with professionals in the relevant field.

You can find more information about the Honors Contract [here](https://sdmiramar.edu/services/honors).

## Textbook

The following textbook is used for this course:  
The Quick Python Book by Naomi Ceder, 3rd edition (June 14 2018), Manning, ISBN: 978-1617294037

To access free resources, you can create a complimentary account on OpenEDG and enroll in “Python Essentials 1” and “Python Essentials 2,” though this step is optional.

I recommend reviewing the notes and resources available on the course site in Canvas.
