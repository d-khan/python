# Syllabus (CISC-179 Python Programming) Honors Contract  
__This syllabus is for Honors Contract Students only__  

## Course description
In this course, you will learn the universal concepts of computer programming, the syntax and semantics of the Python language, practical skills in resolving typical implementation challenges, how to use the most important elements of the Python Standard Library, how to install your runtime environment, how to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.

The students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to do independent research, extra assignments, and 1:1 online meetings with the professor. The student will be involved in Work-Based Learning activities in which students get in touch with career services, improve resume writing and interviewing skills, and get in touch with professionals in the relevant field.

You can find more information about the Honors Contract [here](https://sdmiramar.edu/services/honors).

-  It is the instructor’s discretion to withdraw a student after the add/drop deadline due to excessive absences.
- __(For online classes):__ Students who have not logged into the course for three days before the add/drop deadline will be dropped for non-attendance. 
- __(For inperson classes):__ The instructor will drop the student if a student is absent in the first two weeks.
- Students who remain enrolled in a class beyond the published withdrawal deadline, as stated in the class schedule, will receive an evaluative letter grade in this class. (A, B, C, D, F, P, NP)

## Accommodating Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who may need academic accommodations should contact me as soon as possible.  You and I will work with the Disability Support Programs and Services (DSPS) department to identify your appropriate academic accommodations for this course. 

> DSPS is located in the K1 Student Services building, room K1-204 and can be reached at (619) 388-7312 or by email at miradsps@sdccd.edu. To register or to learn more about their services, please visit their website at www.sdmiramar.edu/dsps

## Undocumented & Immigrant Student Services

Undocumented and immigrant students are welcome in this class. As an educator, I strive to be an ally and provide a safe learning environment for you regardless of your immigration status. Your legal status should not be an obstacle to you in my classroom or to your educational success.
The Miramar Dreamers Support Office provides programs and services to undocumented and immigrant students. The Dreamers staff can meet with you for one-on-one support sessions, connect you to financial aid and scholarship resources, provide information about how to earn money, and host weekly engagement activities. Every student who needs one gets a FREE immigration-related legal consultation with our partners at the Higher Education Legal Services, too!

> Visit the Dreamers Support Office in the Student Services Building, room K1-304 (third floor), or online at <https://sdmiramar.edu/services/dreamers>. Schedule an appointment at <https://bit.ly/dreamerappt>.

## Cheating/Plagiarism
Students are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3 Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 5520, Student Disciplinary Procedures.

## Honest Academic Conduct

Students are expected to adhere to the Honest Academic Conduct policy at all times. Students who violate the Honest Academic Conduct policy may be removed from class by the faculty for the class meeting in which the behavior occurred and the next class meeting.
- For online classes: Student access to class is removed for one week (5 instructional days).

No make-up work will be accepted during the removal.

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities, Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:
<https://www.sdccd.edu/docs/District/procedures/Student%20Services/AP%203100_03.pdf>

## Sustainability
Miramar College is committed to sustainability in our classrooms and on campus. To minimize paper use, please consider whether a document can be shared digitally rather than printed. When a document must be printed, decrease margins to 0.8” and print on both sides of the paper.  
 
You are encouraged to bring reusable drink containers to school (and fill them at the water dispensers located around campus). For single-use packaging, please use the recycle bins for plastics, paper, cans, and cardboard.  
 
Thank you for doing your part to conserve resources in your academic life and keeping our campus environment clean.
