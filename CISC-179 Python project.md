# CISC-179 Python project

## Objective

Apply the skills acquired in this course by implementing a double-linked list. 

## Pre-requisite

- Read [Linked-lists](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/linked-lists/Linked%20lists.html#queues-as-double-linked-lists) before starting coding.

## Tasks to perform

Refrain from using any built-in or already developed linked-list package/method for this project.

- Use Classes & Objects, and create an empty linked list. (2 marks)
- Insert several elements in an empty linked list. Use integer data type. (5 marks)
- Delete several elements in the linked list. (5 marks)
- Implement double-linked lists. (8 marks)

## What to submit?

1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io/) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice.

2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?

3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .py extension. 

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (100%).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (50%).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0%)
