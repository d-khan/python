## Course description
In this course, you will gain an understanding of universal programming concepts, learn the syntax and semantics of the Python language, and develop practical skills for solving common implementation challenges. You will explore key elements of the Python Standard Library, learn how to install and configure your runtime environment, and acquire the ability to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.
