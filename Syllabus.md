## Course description
In this course, you will gain an understanding of universal programming concepts, learn the syntax and semantics of the Python language, and develop practical skills for solving common implementation challenges. You will explore key elements of the Python Standard Library, learn how to install and configure your runtime environment, and acquire the ability to design, develop, test, and debug your own Python programs.

## Textbook
The following textbook is used for this course:  
The Quick Python Book by Naomi Ceder, 3rd edition (June 14 2018), Manning, ISBN: 978-1617294037

To access free resources, you can create a complimentary account on OpenEDG and enroll in “Python Essentials 1” and “Python Essentials 2,” though this step is optional.

I recommend reviewing the notes and resources available on the course site in Canvas.
